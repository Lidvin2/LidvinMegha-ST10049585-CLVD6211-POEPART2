            Cloud computing offers scalability, allowing KhumaloCraft to adapt to changing demands. Whether there's a sudden surge in website traffic or a need to expand operations, cloud computing resources can scale up or down seamlessly, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary expenses.
            Cloud solutions provide accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection. This means KhumaloCraft can manage its operations, update product listings, and engage with customers remotely, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.
            Cloud providers offer robust security measures to safeguard data, including encryption, authentication, and regular backups. This ensures that KhumaloCraft's sensitive information, such as customer data and financial records, remains protected against potential threats.
